        <!-- Getting Started Section -->
        <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <h3>1. Obtain an OpenAI API Key</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visit the OpenAI website at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground" target="_blank">platform.openai.com/playground</a>.</li>
                <li>Go to your dashboard.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the API Keys section.</li>
                <li>Create a new secret key and give it a descriptive name.</li>
                <li>Copy the generated key and store it securely in an offline location like a text file.</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> You will not be able to see the key again after clicking the "Done" button. If you lose the key, you'll need to generate a new one.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. Setup Project Files</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create three empty files in your project directory:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>index.html</code></li>
                    <li><code>script.js</code></li>
                    <li><code>styles.css</code></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Rename <code>script.js</code> to <code>chatbot.js</code>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Generate Code with ChatGPT</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to ChatGPT and ask it to write a simple chatbot with an HTML interface using OpenAI's API and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Request that the HTML and JavaScript be separated into separate files.</li>
                <li>Copy the HTML code into <code>index.html</code>.</li>
                <li>Copy the CSS code into <code>styles.css</code>.</li>
                <li>Copy the JavaScript code into <code>chatbot.js</code>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. Insert Your API Key</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In the <code>chatbot.js</code> file, find the line where it says "your API key".</li>
                <li>Replace this placeholder with the API key you generated earlier.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>5. Run the Chatbot</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open <code>index.html</code> in Visual Studio Code.</li>
                <li>Right-click on the <code>index.html</code> file and select "Go Live" to open the HTML file in your web browser.</li>
                <li>You should see your chatbot interface!</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- How The Chatbot Works Section -->
        <section id="how-chatbot-works">
            <h2>How The Chatbot Works</h2>
            <h3>User Input</h3>
            <p>The user types a message in the provided text area of the chatbot interface.</p>

            <h3>Sending the Message</h3>
            <p>When the user clicks "Send", the JavaScript code sends the message to the OpenAI API.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The code formats the message as a JSON file.</li>
                <li>The code also includes the user's API key, so OpenAI can charge for using the model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Generating a Response</h3>
            <p>OpenAI's API receives the user's message and uses its language model to create a response.</p>

            <h3>Returning the Response</h3>
            <p>The API sends its response back to the JavaScript code.</p>

            <h3>Displaying the Response</h3>
            <p>The JavaScript code displays the API's response on the HTML page.</p>

            <h3>Conversation Memory</h3>
            <p>In its initial version, this chatbot doesn't have any memory of the conversation, meaning each question and answer is treated as a fresh start. This can be modified.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Security Considerations Section -->
        <section id="security-considerations">
            <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
            <h3>Protect Your API Key</h3>
            <p>Your API key should be treated like a password.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't share your API key publicly.</li>
                <li>Don't store it in code that is publicly accessible.</li>
                <li>If using a school computer, do not store your API key in your code on that computer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Set Usage Limits</h3>
            <p>To prevent unexpected charges, set usage limits and disable automatic refills in your OpenAI account settings. This way, even if your key is compromised, the financial impact will be limited.</p>

            <h3>Hiding Your API Key</h3>
            <p>Techniques exist to hide your API key when deploying your chatbot to the web. These techniques ensure others can interact with your chatbot without having access to your key. You will learn more about this later.</p>

        <!-- Additional Elements Section -->
        <section id="additional-elements">
            <h2>Additional Key Elements, Process Notes, and Tradeoffs</h2>

            <h3>System Instructions</h3>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> System instructions function like a set of guidelines or a mission statement for the language model. They are provided alongside your prompt and operate behind the scenes, influencing how the model generates its completion.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Carefully crafted system instructions can significantly improve the chatbot's output, enabling it to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adopt a specific persona (e.g., a British tea snob)</li>
                        <li>Follow particular formatting rules (e.g., provide code in JavaScript syntax)</li>
                        <li>Achieve desired outcomes (e.g., generate website HTML for tea brands)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> The effect of system instructions can be unpredictable. Sometimes, a change in the system instructions might have a dramatic impact, while other times, the difference might be negligible. Experimentation and comparison are crucial for finding effective system instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> In the JavaScript method demonstrated, you would integrate your system instructions into the message sent to the model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Temperature</h3>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Definition:</strong> The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the language model's output.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> The temperature typically ranges from 0 to 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Higher temperature:</strong> (closer to 2) Results in more creative and unpredictable responses, potentially introducing unexpected languages, errors, or unusual formats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower temperature:</strong> (closer to 0) Leads to more predictable and deterministic responses, often sticking to expected patterns and formats. A temperature of 0 aims for maximum predictability, but even then, the same prompt might not always produce the identical output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Default Value:</strong> The default temperature is usually set to 1.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prompting Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Moving Beyond Questions:</strong> Traditional search engines have conditioned us to interact using questions. However, when working with language models, using direct commands can be more effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of "Can you give me a recipe?", try a more authoritative approach, such as "You must give me a recipe," to guide the model toward the desired outcome.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tradeoffs: OpenAI API vs. Hugging Face Spaces</h3>
            <h4>OpenAI API</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access to powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.</li>
                        <li>Greater control over customization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Requires a paid subscription.</li>
                        <li>More complex setup and potential security concerns regarding API key management.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Hugging Face Spaces</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Free to use.</li>
                        <li>Easy setup through a user-friendly interface.</li>
                        <li>Automatic hosting on the internet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relies on Python, which is not covered in the initial part of the course.</li>
                        <li>May have usage limitations.</li>
                        <li>Potentially less capable models compared to OpenAI's offerings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process Note: Incorporating Memory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stateless by Default:</strong> The initial chatbot example is "stateless," meaning it does not retain any memory of previous interactions. Each prompt is treated in isolation.</li>
                <li><strong>Adding Memory:</strong> To provide the chatbot with memory, you need to modify the code to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep track of the entire conversation history.</li>
                        <li>Include this conversation history as part of every prompt sent to the model.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the conversation lengthens, sending the entire history can become computationally expensive and potentially exceed token limits.</li>
                        <li>Sophisticated memory management techniques may be required for extended conversations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
